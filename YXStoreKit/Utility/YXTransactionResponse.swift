     * Apple associates a SKPaymentTransaction with the user's Apple Id only, for apps that have their own
     * account system (such as apps support login with Google), there is no way for the client app to establish
     * the relationship between the transaction and the user's account. To solve this problem, for any given
     * product, only one transaction is allowed at any given time. If user A has a pending transaction for buying
     * product B then even the user switches to user B, user B will not be able to purchase the product until
     * user A finishes his/her transaction.
     * Execution order:
     *       App launches
     *            |
